                    <p class="lead">Book clubs have always been a popular concept since itâ€™s a great way to meet new people, build a community and dig into deep conversations on a specific genre. Podcasts are now a very a new method of consuming and sharing information. We thought that creating an app that could locally connect people with similar podcast interests for discussion would be of great interest especially during a time of isolation.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Our group interviewed 5 people using the below research question and objectives to develop our 15 interview questions.<br>
                Research Question: Would people connect with other people in their area that have similar interests in podcasts? <br>
                Objectives: 
                <ul>
                <li>To understand how people connect to each other about podcasts now.</li>
                <li>To understand what means/avenues people listen to podcasts.</li>

              <h5 class="card-title">User Insight & Problem Statement</h5>
              <p class="card-text">From our survey results and interviews, we found that podcast listeners enjoy socializing with people with similar interests, often using podcasts as a way to connect. We also discovered that people are feeling bored, depressed and isolated due to the pandemic. 
                Therefore, we believe that users would want to connect through a new social application and we might be able to help by creating an avenue in which they are able to discuss common interests in podcasts with other users in the area.</p>
                <p>How might we create a space where everyone is able to discover, cultivate, and explore new interests while building healthy, social connections during a time of isolation?
